I created this embedded system to practice C++ and apply the electrical engineering concepts I was learning at the time in the form of a fun little game. This project taught me how to debug both hardware and software, along with how both work together. I also learned the importance of modular programming by building each part of the code separately in their own functions.

The schematic for the circuit is shown below:

The code for this project can be found in the simon-says.cpp file.
